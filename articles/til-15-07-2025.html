  <h2>How does one connect to an RDS instance?</h2>
  <p>First of all, there is the RDS api through which one can make action calls to AWS to perform actions in the RDS service level.</p>
  <p>These actions would include create an instance, stopping it, describing it, etc https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html</p>
  <p>With regards to connection in the Database level, an RDS instance can have two connection endpoints: a private and a public IP. Regarless of its configuration the instance will always have the private IP inside its vpc and subnet group.</p>
  <p>If the instance is public, then it also gets a public IP accessible by everyone on the web.</p>
  <p>The difference here is how the its name is resolved. If the client within the RDS VPC (or in a reachable VPC) the RDS name will be resolved to the private IP.</p>
  <p>If the name is seached through an AWS-external client, the name will be resolved to the public IP.</p>
  <p>The importance of this mechanism is avoid outside traffic to the VPC, which inccours in extra cost.</p>
